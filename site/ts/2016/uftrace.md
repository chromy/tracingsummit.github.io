## Abstract
The ftrace framework in Linux kernel utilizes function instrumentation techniques from compilers to provide deeper understanding of kernel execution behavior and performance characteristics. The same thing can be provided to userspace programs.

In this talk, Namhyung will share his experience and result of his work about the function (graph) tracer for userspace programs. This includes the design, implementation, future work and limitations.

## Audience
User space developers might want to see how to use the function tracer for their program. Tracing tool developers might want to discuss issues regarding the design and implementation.

## Biography
Namhyung Kim is a senior kernel developer in LG Electonics and have been involved in the development of the perf and ftrace since 2012.
