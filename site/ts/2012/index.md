The Tracing Summit 2012 was held in San Diego, on August 30th, 2012, as part of the Linux Plumbers Conference 2012.

It focuses on the tracing area, gathering people involved in development and end-users of tracing tools as well as trace analysis tools. The main target of this one day conference is to provide room for discussion between people in the various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

We are welcoming presentations from both end users and developers, on topics covering, but not limited to:

* Trace collection and extraction,
* Trace filtering,
* Trace aggregation,
* Trace formats,
* Tracing multi-core systems,
* Trace abstraction,
* Trace modeling,
* Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
* Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
* Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
* Trace visualisation,
* Interaction between debugging and tracing,
* Tracing remote control,
* Analysis of large trace datasets.

It can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet non-existing technologies (which are compellingly interesting to end-users).

This track will contain presentations of about 30 minutes per subject with discussion.

## Registration
Registration for this event is included with registration to Linux Plumbers Conference 2012 Registration. Both speakers and assistance need to be registered to Linux Plumbers Conference 2012.
