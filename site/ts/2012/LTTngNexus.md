## Abstract
Freescale QorIQ devices support Nexus Trace for several members of its family of devices. To better support LTTng users who also want to use Nexus trace, Freescale developed LTTngX. LTTngX is a CodeWarrior specific feature that allows QorIQ Nexus trace data to be loaded and displayed with LTTng trace data. This presentation will provide an overview of our work, including a quick look at the QorIQ debug IP and how support for Nexus in LTTng has been implemented in CodeWarrior.
