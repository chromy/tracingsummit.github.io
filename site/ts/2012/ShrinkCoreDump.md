## Abstract
Core dumps can be too large for permanent storage on embedded systems. The goal of the mini-core dump project is to provide a configurable excerpt of a full core dump. That allows space savings and eventually the storage of multiple dumps which enhances the debugability because it allows the observation of patterns. This talk gives an overview of the background and the current implementation.
