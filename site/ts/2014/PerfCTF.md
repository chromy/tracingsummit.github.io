## Abstract
The presentation will give an overview of both perf and CTF data storage formats and will focus on mutual comparison of both formats. I will outline (so far) considered ways of conversions from perf data file into CTF stream and discuss possible implications of mixing both perf and CTF data. As the practical side of the talk I'll introduce and describe new perf command, which allows perf to CTF data conversion.

## Biography
