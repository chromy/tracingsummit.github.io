## Abstract
Introducing features that never made it to perf for various reasons and ended up forgotten in old git branches. Failing performance or lost interest are some of the reasons they were never posted or accepted upstream.

In this presentation I'll go through following list of features and describe what we were aiming for, why we failed and if there's any hope for future:

* threaded record/report
* delayed user space data retrievals
* bpf subcommand
* watch subcommand
* RDT support
* event triggers
* group sharing
* build/menuconfig

## Target audience
The talk assumes basic knowledge of perf and its usage.

## Bio
Jiri works for RedHat full time on Linux as kernel generalist engineer in Brno office, Czech Republic.
