## Abstract
Intel Processor Trace (PT), and its older sibling RTIT, are now widely available in Intel systems, and integrated into Linux perf. PT allows efficient control flow tracing of workloads running on the CPU, while integration into the OS allows its use without special tracing hardware. This talk gives an overview of the Intel PT, how it is implemented in Linux, and how it can be used. It gives an overview on the Linux perf implementation and shows some related tools.

## Audience
People interested in tracing program calls and branches using hardware tracing.
