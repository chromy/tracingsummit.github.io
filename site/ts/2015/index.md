The Tracing Summit 2015 will be held in Seattle, WA, USA on August 20th, 2015, at the Sheraton Seattle, colocated with LinuxCon North America 2015.

Now organized by the [Linux Foundation Diagnostic and Monitoring Workgroup](http://diamon.org), this event focuses on the tracing area, gathering people involved in development and end-users of tracing tools as well as trace analysis tools. The main target of this Tracing Summit is to provide room for discussion between people in the various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

We are welcoming presentations from both end users and developers, on topics covering, but not limited to:

* Trace collection and extraction,
* Trace filtering,
* Trace aggregation,
* Trace formats,
* Tracing multi-core systems,
* Trace abstraction,
* Trace modeling,
* Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
* Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
* Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
* Trace visualisation,
* Interaction between debugging and tracing,
* Tracing remote control,
* Analysis of large trace datasets,
* Cloud trace collection and analysis,
* Integration between trace tools,
* Live tracing & monitoring.

Those can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet non-existing technologies (which are compellingly interesting to end-users).

There is a single track, containing presentations between 30 and 45 minutes per subject with discussion.
