The Tracing Summit is a conference gathering people involved in the development of tracing tools and also end-users. The main target of this conference is to provide room for discussion between people in the various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

It is organized by the [Linux Foundation Diagnostic and Monitoring Workgroup](https://diamon.org).
