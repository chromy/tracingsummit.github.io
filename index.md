The 2022 Tracing Summit is a three-day, single-track conference on the topic of tracing. The event focuses on software and hardware tracing, gathering developers and end-users of tracing and trace analysis tools. The main goal of the Tracing Summit is to provide space for discussion between people of the various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

## Details
- Location: Google, 6 Pancras Sq, London N1C 4AG, UK
- Dates: Tuesday the 11th to Thursday the 13th of October, 2022
- Cost: Free

## Registration

## Presentation Proposals
The Call for Proposals can be found here [Tracing Summit October 2022 - Call for Proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf65-LaD5EiYSxSN6D6XGRazExSur0SW7oG6ZIpGpDN4ra_rg/viewform), it will close on September 6th 2022. The talk selection will then be confirmed by September 9th 2022.

## Schedule
To be finalised.

## Presentations
We are welcoming 30 minute presentations from both end users and developers, on topics covering, but not limited to:

* Investigation workflow of Real-Time, latency, and throughput issues,
* Trace collection and extraction,
* Trace filtering,
* Trace aggregation,
* Trace formats,
* Tracing multi-core systems,
* Trace abstraction,
* Trace modeling,
* Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
* Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
* Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
* Trace visualisation,
* Interaction between debugging and tracing,
* Tracing remote control,
* Analysis of large trace datasets,
* Cloud trace collection and analysis,
* Integration between trace tools,
* Live tracing & monitoring,
* Programmable tracing (e.g. eBPF).

Those can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet non-existing technologies (which are compellingly interesting to end-users). Please understand that this open forum is not the proper place to present sales or marketing pitches, nor technologies which are prevented from being freely used in open source.
