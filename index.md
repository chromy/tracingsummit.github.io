The 2022 Tracing Summit is a three-day, single-track conference on the topic of tracing. The event focuses on software and hardware tracing, gathering developers and end-users of tracing and trace analysis tools. The main goal of the Tracing Summit is to provide space for discussion between people of the various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

## Details
- Location: **Google, Central St Giles 1 - 13 St Giles High Street, London, WC2H 8AG, UK** [<- NEW LOCATION!](#new-location).
- Dates: Tuesday the 11th to Thursday the 13th of October, 2022
- Cost: Free

## Schedule
Timings to be finalised.
* [LTTng: Beyond Ring-Buffer Based Tracing](/ts/2022/beyondtheringbuffer), Jérémie Galarneau (EfficiOS)
* [Libpatch - Dynamic patching of binaries in userspace](/ts/2022/libpatch), Olivier Dion (Polytechnique Montréal)
* [Visual eBPF: Live Programming Observability on Linux](/ts/2022/visualebpf), Nikita Baksalyar
* [Analysing Perfetto Android traces at every scale](/ts/2022/analysingandroidtraces), Lalit Maganti (Google)
* [Adding the Interaction to Next Paint Metric to Perfetto](/ts/2022/nextpaint), Patricija Cerkaite

## Presentations
We are welcoming 30 minute presentations from both end users and developers, on topics covering, but not limited to:

* Investigation workflow of Real-Time, latency, and throughput issues,
* Trace collection and extraction,
* Trace filtering,
* Trace aggregation,
* Trace formats,
* Tracing multi-core systems,
* Trace abstraction,
* Trace modeling,
* Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
* Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
* Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
* Trace visualisation,
* Interaction between debugging and tracing,
* Tracing remote control,
* Analysis of large trace datasets,
* Cloud trace collection and analysis,
* Integration between trace tools,
* Live tracing & monitoring,
* Programmable tracing (e.g. eBPF).

Those can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet non-existing technologies (which are compellingly interesting to end-users). Please understand that this open forum is not the proper place to present sales or marketing pitches, nor technologies which are prevented from being freely used in open source.

## New location

We've managed to secure a larger room to make space for more attendees.
The room is in a different building to what was previously advertised here.

The summit will now be located at:  **Google, Central St Giles 1 - 13 St Giles High Street, London, WC2H 8AG, UK**

Instead of the previously announced location: Google, 6 Pancras Sq, London, N1C 4AG, UK.
The two buildings are nearby traveling between them takes 10-30min depending on if you travel by Uber/Lyft/Taxi, public transport, bike rental, or foot.
We apologise for this late change to the location but we think that it is worth it to allow for more attendees.
