## Abstract
This talk will present the latest iteration of the Tracing and Monitoring Framework (TMF). TMF started as a collection of Eclipse plugins to analyze LTTng traces. Since then, it has evolved into a generic trace analysis framework, and can now even be installed as a stand-alone application based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform.

Recent improvements to be demoed:

* Standalone RCP, making it much easier for non-Eclispse users to install and use
* Automatic trace type detection on import
* Call stack view, automatically available for LTTng-UST traces with function entry/exit tracepoints

As well as a preview of upcoming features:

* Data-driven definition of trace types and views
* Trace synchronization
* Index on disk
