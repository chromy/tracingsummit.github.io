## Abstract
Perf-probe dynamic event tracing is a fundamental feature for behavior analysis, performance analysis, and debugging. Recently, it has many updates and planned works as ARM porting/enhancement, perf-probe caching, and SDT support etc. Especially, perf-probe cache allows you to use dynamic probe on remote machine safely. This presentation will show you these efforts including ongoing works.

## Audience
The main target audiences are the kernel developers and administrators who are interested in the kernel-level trouble analysis.
