## Abstract
Facebook systems are complex and are stressing the Linux kernel in various, extreme, ways. As we move to kernels that are closer to mainline, we need tools to help us improve the kernel stability and performance. This presentation will describe how we use the various Linux tracing tools for debugging and continuous performance monitoring. We will also cover the road blocks that we faced and what improvements would be a benefit to us.

## Audience
Tracing tool developers to learn how their tools are used in a large scale system and general tracing users to see some real life usages.
