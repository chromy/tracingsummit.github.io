## Abstract
Troubleshooting or monitoring high availability, high throughput systems has to be done carefully, adding the pervasive use of multicore technology and we are in a situation where an increasing numbers of problems can only be diagnosed via tracing. This talk will describe why certain characteristics of tracing tools are important, how to develop systems with built-in diagnostic, best practices on tracing and how to analyse the data. Industry initiatives such as the common trace format (Multicore Association, Linux CE Workgroup) and trace analysis at the Eclipse Foundation will also be described in a hope to create an industry de-facto way of developing SW with diagnostic in mind. Programmers, experienced system administrators and managers should find relevant information on how to improve troubleshooting of high throughput/availability system, embedded systems and HPC.
