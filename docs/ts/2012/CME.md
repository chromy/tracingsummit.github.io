## Abstract
CME Group's electronic trading infrastructure runs on Linux. When performance issues arise, diagnostic tools that work well in a low-latency environment with high uptime requirements are essential. Some thoughts on how we use and deploy Linux, our challenges, and what we're looking for in our "toolkit" will be presented. The goal is to provide an end-user perspective on tracing tools.
