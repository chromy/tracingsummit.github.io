## Abstract
The Babeltrace project is the reference implementation of the Common Trace Format (CTF) specification and provides tools to manipulate CTF traces. The original Babeltrace provided basic facilities to read and write traces. Babeltrace 2, which has been under development for the better part of two years, broadens the project's scope.

This presentation will show how Babeltrace 2's new architecture allows you to easily create analysis scripts and flexibly manipulate CTF traces from the command line.

## Audience
Tracing users who are interested in writting their own analyses to extract metrics and monitor systems using system traces.

## Biography
Jérémie Galarneau maintains the LTTng-tools and Babeltrace projects, and has contributed to various open-source projects over the years. His experience covers real-time image processing, graphics programming, and tracing tools development.
