The Tracing Summit 2016 will be held in Berlin, Germany on October 12th, 2016, at the Maritim Hotel Berlin (Stauffenbergstraße 26, 10785 Berlin), co-located with Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2016.

Organized by the [Linux Foundation Diagnostic and Monitoring Workgroup](http://diamon.org), this event focuses on the tracing area, gathering people involved in development and end-users of tracing tools as well as trace analysis tools. The main target of this Tracing Summit is to provide room for discussion between people in the various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

We are welcoming presentations from both end users and developers, on topics covering, but not limited to:

* Investigation workflow of Real-Time, latency, and throughput issues,
* Trace collection and extraction,
* Trace filtering,
* Trace aggregation,
* Trace formats,
* Tracing multi-core systems,
* Trace abstraction,
* Trace modeling,
* Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
* Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
* Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
* Trace visualisation,
* Interaction between debugging and tracing,
* Tracing remote control,
* Analysis of large trace datasets,
* Cloud trace collection and analysis,
* Integration between trace tools,
* Live tracing & monitoring.

Those can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet non-existing technologies (which are compellingly interesting to end-users). Please understand that this open forum is not the proper place to present sales or marketing pitches, nor technologies which are prevented from being freely used in open source.

There is a single track, containing presentations between 30 and 45 minutes per subject with discussion.
