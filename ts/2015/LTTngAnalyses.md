## Abstract
The LTTng project has focused in the past few years on lowering the barrier to entry for tracing used by non-expert Linux end-users. We will present the progress on LTTng analyses, scripting facilities in Babeltrace, as well as the ongoing work on in-kernel and in-application aggregation of latency distributions.

## Audience
Devops, Developers, Linux users, experts and non-experts, interested in understanding their system performance and behavior.
