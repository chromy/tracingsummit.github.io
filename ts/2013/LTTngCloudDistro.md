## Abstract
The latest developments in LTTng include features relevant for use-cases ranging from Linux distribution bug report data collection to cloud monitoring. Amongst those features, we notably find the live streaming of traces over the network, which allows analysis of live traces as the are being gathered. We also find flight recorder tracing, with non-stop snapshot feature, which allows augmenting distribution bug reports with a trace of events that precede each bug. Those features will be presented, along with discussion of the project roadmap.
