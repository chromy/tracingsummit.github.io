## Abstract
The Linux perf tools and ftrace are main performance analysis tools in the Linux kernel. While they're focusing on different parts of the picture, they can share many things to do the job thanks to the libtraceevent (which also resides in the kernel).

In this presentation, I'll update and share current status of the integration work and discuss implementation issues to be resolved.
