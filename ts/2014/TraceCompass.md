## Abstract
Trace Compass (previously TMF) is an extensible framework for building trace analysis and visualization tools. With the built-in CTF and Pcap parsers we will demonstrate analyses of data at network, hypervisor, operating system and application level using a simple distributed application. You will see:

* Network traffic analysis: Correlate network traces (Pcap) with application traces,
* Data driven analysis: Analyze and visualize recorded data in custom views without writing of a single line of Java code,
* Virtual machine analysis: If the applications is in a virtualized environment, the host and VM's traces can be correlated and show the resource usage (CPU, VCPU). We can observe a totally different execution than the one from 2 different machines. and explain latencies in the application's execution.
