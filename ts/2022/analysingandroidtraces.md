title: Analysing Perfetto Android traces at every scale
---

## Abstract
In this talk, I'll explain how, in Google, we analyse Perfetto traces collected from Android devices at every scale. This ranges from a single device on a desk to tens of thousands collected from our internal testing population. I'll take you through the tools we've built, the metrics we extract from traces and how we use these to improve the performance of Android.

## Biography
Lalit has been working at Google on Perfetto for the past 5 years. He is the author of trace processor, a C++ trace analysis library which allows querying traces and extracting metrics. He also takes an active role in consulting for other teams on how they can make better use of tracing to improve performance of their products.
