title: "Hardware trace for software developers"
---

## Abstract
Hardware trace can help us understand software performance at nanosecond resolution. I'll talk about different kinds of hardware trace, and how to deploy hardware trace in open-source tools and on real-world systems. I'll use examples from Arm architecture (including CoreSight ETM), but the techniques are broadly applicable.
